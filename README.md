About ToDo:

A ToDo is designed to help users manage their tasks, to-do lists and schedules. The primary purpose of a ToDo website is to keep users organized and on top of their daily, weekly, or long term responsibilities. These websites typically offer a user friendly interface that allows individuals to create, edit, prioritize and mark tasks completed.

User Flow:

At first when we get into the website we get into the sign up/sign in page, there if the person is already having an account then he/she needs to click on the link of sign up to go into sign up area where he/she needs to give the name, username and password. After sign up he/she needs to go to the sign in page to sign in into the ToDo by giving the email and password. Then it will go into the welcome page where there will be a get started option, on clicking that it will go to the main ToDo page where you can add your tasks to be completed or marks the tasks as completed. There is one dark mode feature in the navigation bar, by clicking on that the page will transform into dark theme. You can know about the team members name in the about option the navigation bar. When the work is completed you can sign out from that which will take you into the sign in/sign up page.
